+ Beta released!
+ Primary public response has been incredibly supportive, thank you for your comments via twitter and reddit!  

**So what's next?**

+ Cleaning! The packages on github and the .iso were solely intended
to provide a proof-of-concept. As such, there's quite a bit of
incorrect information in them (maintainer, descriptions, licences).
+ Our immediate plans for the future are to iron out some of the remaining issues in the distro (ideally before the impending official Jessie launch).
The goal is to have a release client with no known bugs around April or May so that when Jessie becomes the new stable, we'll be able to just run our build script,
host, and enjoy!
+ 64-bit version.
+ A repo! Linux is about sharing and bettering the community, not only would
our own repo give us the venue for updates within the distro, but also give
access to our new set of packages for those on other distros who might like
to experience the #!++ meta.
+ Once we get to a fully functional release, then our plan is to update
some of the nonessentials (new cb-welcome with more current options, new cb-pipemenus, new themes/backgrounds etc.)
