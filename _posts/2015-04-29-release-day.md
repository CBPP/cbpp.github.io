+ Earlier this week Debian 8 "Jessie" launched, and all the world rejoiced!
+ All our packages have been extensively tested and retested and it's time for the big reveal.

+ 32-bit and 64-bit images are both now available with EFI support and networking non-frees on disc.
+ Thanks to everyone who helped with Beta and RC testing!
+ Give it a download and let us know what you think. Cheers!
