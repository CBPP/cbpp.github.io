**Addressing Some Controversy**

Today I reached out to Philip Newborough -- corenominal -- creator of the
original #!. There has been some community concern expressed that the project's
name encroaches upon the original and that our teaser banner might be found
offensive.  

Corenominal responded:  
>*I think there has been some confusion somewhere, I love the image and
  I have no problem with you using the CrunchBang++ name. I wish you all
  the best with the project and I hope it's a huge success for you.  
>To clarify, no pain, love the image, love the name.  
>Keep rockin'*
