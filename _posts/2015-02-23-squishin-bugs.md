+ Lots of progress made on the [Git repo](https://github.com/CBPP) today.
+ Things are really coming together. If I can stay on track, release client should ready to go inside the next week or two.
+ Side note, now taking submissions for new wallpapers! The default fabric tile will stay in place, but if you've got an artistic hand: submit a pull
request on the wallpaper repo, send an email to **computermouth[at]crunchbangplusplus.org**, or reach me on twitter **@computermouth**.
