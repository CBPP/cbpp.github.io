+ We have migrated the existing site over to Github Pages. This probably should have been done a while ago but at the time it was the easiest thing to do for me.
+ The **Proudly Hosted by Digital Ocean** link still remains because our repo is still hosted on their site and the ref link money will still be used for that. They have also donated to help us run our servers a bit ago.
+ I know there has not be many updates recently but there is a lot of activity on [reddit]("https://www.reddit.com/r/crunchbangplusplus") where a lot more up to date news and topics can be found.
