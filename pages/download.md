####HEADS UP
Keep in mind, as the distro is currently based off of the Debian netinst, an internet connection will be required. This is in no way a finished product. The Beta is currently more of a proof-of-concept than a full fledged release. As such, some breakage may arise through normal use. Regardless, experienced users and those familiar with the issues between Jessie and the #! metapackage will likely be familiar with the issues and should have no problem using this as a daily driver. While we don't forsee any serious issues at this time, INSTALL AT YOUR OWN RISK. We are not responsible for any loss of data or otherwise unexpected consequences. VMs would be the safest choice until we can test further.

####KNOWN BUGS
+ Thunar home shortcuts are missing (change manually in ~/.gtk-bookmarks)
+ cb-welcome prompts are mostly/all non-responsive
+ cp-pipemenus (Install Chromium, Install LibreOffice, etc...) are non-responsive

####BETA IS 32-BIT
64-bit release will be available **very soon**.
