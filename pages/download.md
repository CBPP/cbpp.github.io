####INTERNET CONNECTION REQUIRED
Keep in mind, as the distro is currently based off of the Debian netinstall, an internet connection will be required.

####NOTE
 + Both releases support EFI
 + Neither release supports Secure Boot
 + Some laptop trackpads will be inoperable during installation, despite working properly in the OS itself.

####DOWNLOAD
**32-bit**  
[i386.torrent](/assets/misc/cbpp-1.0-i386-20150428.iso.torrent)  

**64-bit**  
[amd64.torrent](/assets/misc/cbpp-1.0-amd64-20150428.iso.torrent)

Each .iso will fit on a standard cd, or write it to a flash drive:  
>:~$ sudo dd if=cbpp-1.0-amd64-20150428.iso of=/dev/sdX
