####INTERNET CONNECTION REQUIRED
Keep in mind, as the distro is currently based off of the Debian netinstall, an internet connection will be required.

####NOTE
 + Both releases support EFI
 + Neither release supports Secure Boot
 + Some laptop trackpads will be inoperable during installation, despite working properly in the OS itself.
