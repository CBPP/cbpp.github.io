<p>
All donations will go towards #!++ server costs. Next to making the project
stable, keeping it up and running is our first priority. CBPP started with the
acknowledgement that I may just be paying for the project out of pocket for as
long as possible, but obviously, any donation would be welcome.
Right now, we have three small servers from Digital Ocean running to keep the
separate systems modular and snappy. In the future, that number might grow
should the community develop and warrant it.
<br>
If donation amounts start to exceed CBPP's server costs, we will be donating whatever extra to Debian.
