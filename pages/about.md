**#!++**  
CrunchBang++ is an open source and completely free *[of cost (#!++ does include several of Debian's non-free packages as well as the non-free repository)]* computer operating system, designed as a continuation of the CrunchBang Linux distribution, based on newer Debian 8 (Jessie) packages and built around the minimal and lightweight Openbox window manager. CrunchBang++ is also known as CBPP or #!++ or CrunchBang Plus Plus.

**Currently Distributed as a 32-bit installable ISO image**  
Currently, the CrunchBang++ distribution is available for download as an installable ISO image that fits perfectly on a CD disc and includes software packages optimized only for computers supporting the 32-bit instruction set architecture. Of course, you can also use a USB thumb drive of 1GB or higher capacity to boot and install the operating system on your computer.

**Installing CrunchBang++**  
CrunchBang++ is not a live system, so you will have to install it using either the graphical (recommended) or text-mode installers offered at boot. Basically, the user will only have to choose a language, select his/her current location, configure the keyboard, configure the network, set up users and passwords, configure the clock, partition the disk, configure the package manager, and install the bootloader.

**Minimal user interface built around Openbox**  
CrunchBang++ uses the same minimal user interface that was available in the CrunchBang Linux operating system, built around the Openbox window manager. The layout consists of a Conky-based system monitoring widget on the right side of the desktop, as well as a panel located on the upper part of the screen, which can be used to interact with running programs or cycle between multiple workspaces.

**Default applications**  
Default applications include Geany IDE, Terminator terminal emulator, Thunar file manager, GIMP image editor, Viewnior image viewer, VLC Media Player, Xfburn CD/DVD burning software, Iceweasel web browser, gFTP file transfer client, Transmission BitTorrent client, XChat IRC client, AbiWord word processor, Gnumeric spreadsheet editor, and Evince document viewer.
